Solution for QA Engineer Technical Test

I have used Maven based Java Project with Cucumber BDD framework

Reason for Maven based Java Project, is to handle all the dependencies and cli(Command Line Interface) execution of the test

Reason for Cucumber BDD framework, is to provide clear information of what actually trying to test and compare the results

Application URL used : https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers

Test Features are available in the below path:
src\test\resources\features

Decisions performed on the application under test(AUT):
    Add a new computer (USR_001_AddComputer.feature)
    Edit existing computer (USR_002_EditExistingComputer.feature)
    Delete existing computer (USR_003_DeleteExistingComputer.feature)

Note:
Data provided in the test is not getting reflected in the application, only happy path is automated for now.
